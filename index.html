title: Erase your IL juvenile record

<h1>
  Erase your Illinois juvenile record!
</h1>
<p>
  If you were arrested in IL when you were under 18, you probably have a juvenile record.
</p>
<p>
  A juvenile record does not go away on its own, and you're better off without one. The good news: most juvenile records can be erased through a process called juvenile expungement.
